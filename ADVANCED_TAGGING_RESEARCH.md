4 = 31-60 days (Recent)
3 = 61-90 days (Moderate)
2 = 91-180 days (At-Risk)
1 = 180+ days (Churned)

Frequency Score (1-5):
5 = 10+ orders (Loyal)
4 = 7-9 orders (Frequent)
3 = 4-6 orders (Regular)
2 = 2-3 orders (Occasional)
1 = 1 order (One-time)

Monetary Score (1-5):
5 = Top 20% spenders (VIP)
4 = 20-40% (High Value)
3 = 40-60% (Medium Value)

1 = Bottom 20% (Minimal)
```

**11 Key Customer Segments:**
